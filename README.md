# Facial Emotions Classification
Applied MLP and CNN principles to classify a dataset of 30,000 greyscale images of faces into 7 categories on the basis of emotions/expressions.

 _The CNN implementation gives a much better result but the local resources were not sufficient to run the desired nuumber of epochs. Will have to re run on colab _
